In class we discussed the concept of journalism as 'people' and that journalism should be 'truth seeking'. Every data point represents a lived experience and every statistic impacts a group of people.

In this article, The New York Times and Siena College called 75,299 Iowans to complete a poll. Out of the 75,299 people, 584 of those who completed the survey were likely to caucus in Iowa. They then conducted interviews with 15 of them to gain their perspective on the upcoming Iowa caucus and on other various topics. 

I selected this article because I liked how it combines numbers (survey poll results) with a humanistic component (putting a face behind those numbers). However, does the way in which this information is presented show the larger picture of Iowa Democratic voters? What biases are present?
